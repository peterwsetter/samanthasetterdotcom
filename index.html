                        <p>Preclinical ophthalmic imaging is crucial for examining models of ocular diseases, evaluating effectiveness, and assessing safety in translational research. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence are non-invasive imaging techniques commonly utilized to view changes in the retina. In addition, ocular electrophysiological assessments, including electroretinography (ERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) are often performed to evaluate retinal and visual path functionality. These techniques all require precision, consistency, and proper laboratory animal management to provide high-quality, reproducible data. These assessments rely on accurate animal positioning, proper electrode/ equipment placement, controlled environmental lighting, and the administration of anesthesia or sedation to ensure reliable and reproducible results. MD ophthalmologists, veterinary ophthalmologists, and PhD vision scientists have a comprehensive understanding of the human eye anatomy, diseases, and treatments. Incorporating credentialed veterinary technicians (CVTs) into the team helps enhance these procedures, leveraging of their specialized training in animal handling, anesthesia, and diagnostic imaging. Their education in species-specific ocular anatomy, behavior, and physiology improves precision while reducing stress in research animals. CVTs also provide expertise in patient preparation, pain management, and physiological monitoring to ensure data integrity while also prioritizing animal well-being. Proficiency in anesthetic monitoring is especially advantageous in electrophysiology, as reducing physiological variations during testing is essential for interpretation. Their capacity to oversee anesthesia, identify pain or distress, and work within existing protocols enhances both animal care and data integrity. CVTs also facilitate compliance with regulations by ensuring that imaging and electrophysiological procedures align with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and IACUC standards. Creating a synergistic team with expertise in both human and animal medicine helps improve overall efficiency and reproducibility of ophthalmic research while enhancing outcomes and prioritizing animal welfare.</p>

                        <p>Little is known about the pathogenesis of penile prolapses in male mice used in biomedical research. The current standard of care is to maintain tissue health and viability with daily lubrication in the hope of spontaneous resolution. Without resolution, unfavorable outcomes include chronic maintenance or euthanasia. In an attempt to reverse the condition, we developed a novel and noninvasive procedure that uses a lubricated stainless-steel probe to reinsert the penis into the prepuce. To determine the efficacy of this new procedure, as well as the impact of a steroid-containing lubricant to aid reinsertion, we performed the following study. Following researcher consent, penile prolapse cases identified across the entirety of the campus mouse population were enrolled in the study. A physical exam was performed to record body condition, penis and genital health, presence of comorbidities, breeding status, and age to establish a severity-based scoring system. To determine if the lubricant used to reinsert the penis had an effect, mice were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups. The first group underwent reinsertion using a sterile lubricant while the second group was given a lubricant containing dexamethasone. Twenty animals were enrolled in the study, with 10 animals per group. Our novel method of reinsertion reversed the condition in 85% (17/20) of cases with no reoccurrence after 2 wk. When inflammation was not present, 100% (10/10) of reinsertions were successful. In cases with penile inflammation, manual reinsertion was successful in 70% (7/10) of cases. No appreciable difference was observed in the success rate between lubricants with or without steroids (P = 0.56). We have identified 4 primary categories of comorbidities associated with penile prolapses: penis trauma or inflammation, foreign material or infection in the prepuce, secondary to a congenital issue like hydrocephalus, and idiopathic. Based on this study, manual reinsertion appears to be a successful and proven option for all cases except for those with congenital issues. It is clear that murine penile prolapse is a multifactorial condition requiring additional investigation into contributing factors and effective treatment options.</p>

                        <p>Male mice may develop paraphimosis, which is commonly referred to as “penile prolapse.” A non-surgical technique was developed to treat this condition. The treatment consists of pretreating the exteriorized penile tissue with a general lubricant or corticosteroid ointment and then using a probe to replace the penis into the prepuce. The results of the study were favorable, showing an overall 87% success rate. There was no significant difference between the two lubricants used for pre-treatment.</p>
